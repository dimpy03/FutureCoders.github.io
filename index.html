                    <p>Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do
                        things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to
                        teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it
                        better.[1][2]

                        Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from
                        generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to
                        act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.


                        Learning in a library
                        Education may help and guide individuals from one class to another. Educated people and groups
                        can do things like help less-educated people and encourage them to get educated.
                        Non-formal education includes adult basic education, adult literacy education or school
                        equivalency preparation. In non-formal education, someone who is not in school can learn to
                        read, write, and other basic life or job skills. Home education, individualized instruction
                        (such as programmed learning), distance learning and computer-assisted instruction are other
                        possibilities.

                    <h5>Transforming education in India</h5>
                    <p>Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills.
                        Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in
                        elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher
                        education) is usually at a college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or,
                        students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills. This way learners can
                        become qualified to be plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. These course
                        have arrangements for students to get practical experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to
                        do this,
                        Unschooling is when kids learn as they go and do not go to traditional school buildings.
                        Instead, they go on websites, play games, or engage in normal hobbies and learn along the way.
                        The experience of children with "unstructured" lives is that they get into trouble

                    <h5>Lets Grow Together</h5>
                    <p>Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many types of
                        education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools.
                        Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system.
                        Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal
                        education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary education,
                        secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method,
                        like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be
                        distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.
                        The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and
                        the academic field studying educational phenomena.
                        The precise definition of education is disputed and there are disagreements about what the aims
                        of education are and to what extent education is different from indoctrination by fostering
                        critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
                        education. Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values
                        and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This
                        way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized
                        institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies
                        to determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend.
                        International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education
                        for all children.
